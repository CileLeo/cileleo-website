        lemme tell you my name, oh lemme tell you my name... uuhhh I'm confused because uh you know like we're supposed to believe in the ministry right? so is the is the church and state supposed to be separate? Can a confused person get a resolution? I don't understand. You see when you go like that, right, you have a cross, two sticks right? And that's how I felt when I was in Waterloo because when I walked in waterloo and smiled at people, they treated me like a vampire. They used the cross and they went like this by not smiling at me. Hey, hi guys you know me? Leo, the cool guy? Easy going? those who know me, I'm a nobody, ya understand? And you can't kill a person with no body. So why am I afraid? I'm not afraid. I'm afraid of the boogyman. Who's the boogyman? YOU FIGURE IT OUT! I'm getting out of here. I'm going back to Waterloo where the vampires hang out, and I'm gonna wear my sunglasses at night. You know why? Because women show their tits, have short skirts, and then they feel violated when I look at them. Why? because I have sunglasses on and I'm weird. I'm from Humberside. I'm sorry if I made a fool of Humberside but all those people who called me a sleepwalker. I woke up. and now I'm going back to sleep because I'm going to be committed in an isolation room because I'm gonna go back to the ministry and allow them to perceive me as I am. A FUCKED UP! GOODBYE!...... Hey Toronto the good, look at look at this square! It was a shit hole when I worked here! Now looks like New York Manhattan?! Where are the bums? There's no bums here? Toronto doesn't have bums! But Waterloo, they're creating bums, they created me. Why? I don't know! Maybe it's the church. Talk to the Pope, he knows everything. I had it. I'm gonna die. How can you die when you're DEAD... Oh wait a second. I'm gonna be crucified right? I'm not gonna raise my voice.
