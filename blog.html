        <h2>horror games are overrated.</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">08.10.2021</div>
        <p>Recently, I've been browsing itch.io. Whenever I open itch, it instantly shows me 4 horror games. Most of them are not even original in any way. It seems as the horror genre is dying because some fucking retards decided to make "horror" games. They aren't even scary! It's just a little bit of blood, "scary" ambience/noises and the overused VHS shader. It pisses me off so much. I HATE IT! Why can't devs make original games for once??? I know that releasing a "horror" game will instantly give you success and validation because retards see "horror" in the title and their OOGA BOOGA brains instantly click on that shit.. but that doesn't change the fact that you are a FUCK UP! What people should do is - publicly shame horror game developers. All they want is just a number on their screens going up. They don't care about anything else. If people want to make proper horror games, they should be ORIGINAL and ACTUALLY SCARY. Most horror stories/lore is basically the same.. walk thru a forest at night, find house, get kidnapped, and die. Anyways, my point is - stop making horror games, make something else. goodbye.</p>
