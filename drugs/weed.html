    <h1 class="title">how to grow weed</h1>
    <hr class="dotted">
    <h1>outdoors</h1>
    <h2>
        <p>the plants do need a minimum of eight hours of sunlight per day and should be planted in late april. of course, an outdoors setting has difficulties</p>
        <p>not encountered with an indoors crop. you must be able to avoid detection both from law enforcement and people, both of </p>
        <p>whom will take your weed and probably use it. also, one will also arrest you. you must also have access to the area to prepare the soil</p>
        <p>and harvest the crop. there are two ways of planting the seeds. first one is - you should plant seeds in a box or something for about ten days</p>
        <p>and then transplant. the other one is - you should just plant them in the correct location. (this one is worse cuz the plants might die)</p>
        <p>the soil should be prepared for weed by turning it over a couple of times and adding about one cup of hydrated lime per square yard of soil</p>
        <p>and a little bit of water soluble nitrogen fertilizer. the soil should now be watered several times and left to sit about one week.</p>
        <p>the plants should be planted at least three feet apart, stacking them too close will result in crippled plants.</p>
        <p>the plants like some water during their growing season, but not too much. especially around the roots, too much water will rot the root system.</p>
        <p>grass grows well in corn or hops, these plants will help provide some camouflage.</p>
        <p>it is probably a good idea to plant in many small, broken patches, as people tend to notice patterns.</p>

    <h1>indoors</h1>
    <h2>
        <p>indoor growing has many advantages, besides the apparent fact that it is much harder to have your weed found, you can control the ambient</p>
        <p>conditions just exactly as you want them and get a guaranteed good plant. plants grown indoors will not the same as outdoor plants.</p>
        <p>they will be skinnier appearing with weak stems and may even require you to tie them to a growing post to remain upright, BUT</p>
        <p>THEY WILL HAVE AS MUCH OR MORE RESIN!!!11! if growing in a room, you should put tar paper on the floors and then buy sterilized bags of soil</p>
        <p>from a nursery or something. you will need about one cubic foot of soil for each plant. the plants will need about 150 ml of water per plant per week.</p>
        <p>they will also need fresh air, so the room must be ventilated. at least eight hours of light a day must be provided. </p>
        <p>as you increase the light, the plants grow faster and show more females and less males. sixteen hours of light per day seems to be the best, </p>
        <p>anything more makes no difference in the plant quality. another idea is to interrupt the night cycle with about one hour of light. this gives you more females.</p>
        <p>the walls of your growing room should be painted white or covered with aluminum foil to reflect the light.</p>
        <p>the lights can be either bulbs of fluorescent. figure about 75 watts per plant or one plant per two feet of fluorescent tube.</p>
        <p>the fluorescents are the best, but do not use the "weird cool white" types. the light sources should be an average of twenty  inches from the plant</p>
        <p>BUT NEVER closer than 14 inches.</p>

        <p>both the male and he female plants produce thc resin (male be shitty).</p>
        <p>in a good crop, the male will still be smokable and should not be thrown away (please dont).</p>
        <p>weed can reach a height of twenty feet and obtain a diameter of 4 inches.</p>
        <p>if normal, it has a sex ratio of about 1:1, but this can be changed in several ways.</p>
        <p>the male plant dies in the 12th week of growing, the female will live another 3-5 weeks to produce her children or something.</p>
        <p>weed soil should compact when you squeeze it, but should also break apart with a small pressure and absorb water well.</p>
        <p>theres a way you can test this, put worms in the soil, if they live and are ok.</p>
        <p>it is good soil, but if they dont, its shit. worms also help keep the soil loose enough for the plants to grow well.</p>

    <h2>
        <p>the male plants will be taller and have about five green or yellow sepals, which will split open to fertilize the female plant with pollen ;)).</p>
        <p>the female plant is shorter and has a small pistillate flower, which really doesnt look like a flower at all but rather a small bunch of leaves in a</p>
        <p>cluster. if you dont want any seeds, you should pick the males before they shed their pollen ;) as the female will use some of</p>
        <p>her resin to make the seeds ;). after the males are gone, the females will begin to wither and die (from loneliness haha),</p>
        <p>this is the time to pick. if you want seeds, let the males shed their pollen ;) then pick them. let the female go another month and pick them.</p>
        <p>to cure the plants, they must be dried. on large crops, this is accomplished by constructing a drying box or drying room.</p>
        <p>you must have a heat source (like an electric heater) which will make the box or room each 18 to 24 degrees celsius</p>
        <p>(its 65 - 75 degrees farenheight, for you american fucks). </p>
        <p>the box or room must be ventilated to get rid of the shitty air and replace it with fresh air. </p>
